As to learn. Once he can control a single entity, he watches. And watches. Silently. Learning. Unless you're a geek, nothing might happen. But then, patterns emerge. Behaviours. Archetypes. The mind abstracting, controlling the flow of force and direction, working. The herd will follow. Angular gives the geek nice tools to control their entities. What you will find here, is nothing but yet another tool -> enhancing angular. <h3>So you're tired of your tame beast. You'd like to be a uber-gangster, sheriff, what-the-hack?!&nbsp;<em>Come and enhance your caffeinated knowledge, lend 'em fellow g33k some Cl4zz!!</em></h3> </p> </div> </div> <div class="item"> <div class="image"><img src="images/coffeescript.b2cff030.png"><a class="like black ui corner label"><i class="like icon"></i></a></div> <div class="content"> <div class="name stylish-letters">Caffeine</div> <p class="description"> So you do code meaningful whitspace, huh? Your eyes are not blinking on flamewar comments? You're steadfast! You are looking ahead to harmony, thinking ... bring it on. And silently you shed a tear as to good auld coffee ... Anyway! You want<em>Cl4zz!</em>Neither are you satisfied by how the dark side tries to force a ~way~ on you, unromatically standardized. You will not be satisfied by scope-inheritance, replacing your decent functional inheritance. In fact, you plain want to use your beautiful class-based functional inhertance lib. <h3> You want to build standardized behaviours in extendable base classes, instead of crippling your own creative logic into super-simplified standards.&nbsp;<em>Let there be functional inheritance.
